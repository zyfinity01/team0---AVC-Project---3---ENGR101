**_SSH into RPI:_**<br/>
With a tool such as either "Termius" or "Mobaxterm"<br/>
Use IP: 10.140.219.105<br/>
Username: "pi"<br/>
Password: "raspberry"<br/>
(Only works when connected to VIC WIFI or SSH'd into an ECS computer.)<br/>
(tools such as "Termius" or "Mobaxterm" are better SSH clients as they include SFTP making it easy to transfer files.)

_**Setting up AVC simulator:**_<br/>
Mac<br/>
Install Homebrew then type brew install sfml into the command line.<br/>

Linux<br/>
Download SFML and unzip into a nice directory.<br/>

_**Contributing on the code with our IDE's:**_<br/>
Download code:<br/>
To download we go to the repository on Gitlab and then click clone >> visual studio code, what this will do is clone the code onto your personal computer for editing, use the GitLab plugin for VSCODE so that we can push and pull from GitLab easily.

_**Compile and build:**_<br/>
Our makefile does all of these steps automatically by executing make (Mac/Linux) or mingw-make (Windows).
