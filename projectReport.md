Short analysis of Project progress
So far, most of our targeted objectives have been met. We managed to finish off our plan, assign roles to each member, get our contact information, and set up personal devices as well as rPi to be able to connect to the vehicle. In last week’s lab B, we were able to open the gate by exchanging with the server via Wi-Fi. 

We are currently working on finishing the 3D printing for our model (which should be done in today’s lab B). Two of our members have managed to write the basic code for image processing and detecting where the black line should be and which direction the robot should move to. There two versions of the code which is found in GitLab, one is "Temp code" which compiles and is waiting to be tested code, the other code is the initial and slightly modified one which is found in main.cpp in GitLab: https://gitlab.ecs.vuw.ac.nz/course-work/engr101/2021/P3/t0/team0-avc-project-3/-/blob/master/main.cpp.  We have also set up a Trello page to keep track of our code’s weekly progress along with its testing and debugging results. The Trello can be found at https://trello.com/b/xgZP7vA8/project-3-testing-debugging. 


Our objectives for this week are to finish printing the 3D model of the robot and write a code so that it would follow the squiggly line. This is because of the conflict of our COMP 102 test which was last week as well as the weekly assignments from ENGR 121 and COMP 102. 
As of today , 12th May 2021, we are a bit behind with the 3D printing of our model. This is also slowing our process for testing the actual robot to see if it can actually follow a straight line. The deadline for this is on the 16th of May, this Sunday. We are hoping to complete the 3D model by this Friday and hopefully test our code by this Friday as well.
 

In order to advance with the project, as most of the progress is reliant on the 3D model, DB and KC are going in on Thursday to print the rest of it and speed up this process. We have also scheduled a team meeting on Friday to hopefully complete the model and start testing the code. Some members are learning to use the AVC simulator to also advance the code. Although the AVC simulator is a bit different to the actual robot we’re using, it’ll fill in the blanks of the code that we already have and give us a realistic idea of how the robot may behave in real life.
